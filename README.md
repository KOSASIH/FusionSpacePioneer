# Guide

## Calculate Fusion Power

```python
def calculate_fusion_power(mass, velocity, efficiency):
    # Convert mass to kilograms
    mass_kg = mass * 1000  # Assuming mass is given in metric tons

    # Convert velocity to meters per second
    velocity_mps = velocity * 1000  # Assuming velocity is given in kilometers per second

    # Calculate kinetic energy
    kinetic_energy = 0.5 * mass_kg * velocity_mps**2

    # Calculate required fusion power
    fusion_power = kinetic_energy / efficiency

    return fusion_power
```

Usage:
```python
# Example usage
mass = 100  # metric tons
velocity = 0.1  # kilometers per second
efficiency = 0.9  # 90% efficiency

required_power = calculate_fusion_power(mass, velocity, efficiency)
print(f"The required fusion power for interstellar travel is {required_power} watts.")
```

This function calculates the required fusion power for interstellar travel based on the spacecraft's mass, desired velocity, and the efficiency of the fusion reactor. It first converts the mass and velocity to appropriate units (kilograms and meters per second) and then calculates the kinetic energy using the formula 0.5 * mass * velocity^2. Finally, it divides the kinetic energy by the efficiency to obtain the required fusion power in watts.

## Estimate Travel Time 

```markdown
| Reactor Type | Efficiency | Power Output | Other Parameters |
|--------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Design 1     | 0.8        | 1.2 GW       | ...             |
| Design 2     | 0.9        | 1.8 GW       | ...             |
| Design 3     | 0.7        | 1.0 GW       | ...             |
```
```

## 

```python
import math

def estimate_travel_time(distance, velocity, fusion_power):
    # Calculate the acceleration using fusion power and spacecraft mass
    spacecraft_mass = 1000  # kg (example value)
    acceleration = fusion_power / spacecraft_mass
    
    # Calculate the time to reach the target star system
    time = math.sqrt((2 * distance) / acceleration)
    
    # Convert time to years
    travel_time_years = time / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60)
    
    return travel_time_years
```

Example usage:
```python
distance_to_target = 4.22 * 9.461e+15  # meters (distance to Proxima Centauri)
spacecraft_velocity = 0.1 * 299792458  # meters per second (10% of the speed of light)
fusion_power_available = 1e+14  # watts

estimated_time = estimate_travel_time(distance_to_target, spacecraft_velocity, fusion_power_available)
print(f"Estimated travel time: {estimated_time:.2f} years")
```

This code defines a function `estimate_travel_time` that takes the distance to the target star system, spacecraft velocity, and fusion power available as inputs. It calculates the acceleration based on the fusion power and spacecraft mass, then uses the calculated acceleration to estimate the time required to reach the target star system. The estimated time is then converted to years and returned as the output.

Note: The example values used for distance, velocity, and fusion power are just placeholders. You should replace them with appropriate values for your specific scenario.

## Simulate Fusion Reactor Performance

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_fusion_reactor_performance(power_output, efficiency):
    """
    Simulates the performance and efficiency of a fusion reactor design for interstellar travel.
    
    Parameters:
    - power_output (float): The fusion reactor's power output in watts.
    - efficiency (float): The efficiency of the fusion reactor.
    
    Returns:
    - travel_time (float): The estimated travel time in years.
    """
    # Constants
    G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
    c = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s
    
    # Inputs
    distance = 4.22 * 9.461e+15  # Distance to the target star system in meters (e.g., Proxima Centauri)
    velocity = 0.1 * c  # Spacecraft's velocity in m/s
    
    # Calculate the required fusion power based on inputs
    mass = power_output / (efficiency * c**2)
    
    # Calculate the acceleration and travel time
    acceleration = power_output / (mass * velocity)
    travel_time = np.sqrt(2 * distance / acceleration) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60)  # Convert seconds to years
    
    return travel_time

# Example usage
power_output = 1e12  # Fusion reactor's power output in watts
efficiency = 0.1  # Efficiency of the fusion reactor

travel_time = simulate_fusion_reactor_performance(power_output, efficiency)
print(f"Estimated travel time: {travel_time:.2f} years")
```

This code defines a function `simulate_fusion_reactor_performance` that takes the fusion reactor's power output and efficiency as inputs and simulates the performance and efficiency of the fusion reactor design for interstellar travel. It uses the previously calculated fusion power to estimate the travel time to the target star system.

The function first initializes the constants, such as the gravitational constant and the speed of light. It then sets the distance to the target star system (e.g., Proxima Centauri) and the spacecraft's velocity.

Next, it calculates the required fusion power based on the inputs provided. The mass of the spacecraft is determined by dividing the power output by the product of the efficiency and the speed of light squared.

Finally, the function calculates the acceleration and travel time using the derived mass. The travel time is calculated using the formula for constant acceleration motion, and it is converted from seconds to years.

An example usage of the function is provided, where the fusion reactor's power output is set to `1e12` watts and the efficiency is set to `0.1`. The estimated travel time is then printed to the console.

Note: This code assumes that the fusion reactor's power output and efficiency are provided as inputs. The actual values should be determined based on the specific fusion reactor design being simulated.

## Optimize Fusion Reactor Parameters

```python
def optimize_fusion_reactor_parameters():
    # Define the range of values for each parameter
    fuel_composition_range = [0.1, 0.5]  # Range of fuel composition (e.g., deuterium to tritium ratio)
    temperature_range = [100000, 1000000]  # Range of temperature in Kelvin
    confinement_time_range = [1, 10]  # Range of confinement time in seconds
    
    # Initialize the maximum power output and efficiency
    max_power_output = 0
    max_efficiency = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible combinations of parameters
    for fuel_composition in range(fuel_composition_range[0], fuel_composition_range[1] + 1):
        for temperature in range(temperature_range[0], temperature_range[1] + 1):
            for confinement_time in range(confinement_time_range[0], confinement_time_range[1] + 1):
                # Calculate the power output and efficiency for the current parameter combination
                power_output = calculate_power_output(fuel_composition, temperature, confinement_time)
                efficiency = calculate_efficiency(fuel_composition, temperature, confinement_time)
                
                # Check if the current parameter combination yields higher power output and efficiency
                if power_output > max_power_output and efficiency > max_efficiency:
                    max_power_output = power_output
                    max_efficiency = efficiency
                    optimal_fuel_composition = fuel_composition
                    optimal_temperature = temperature
                    optimal_confinement_time = confinement_time
    
    # Return the optimal fusion reactor parameters and their corresponding power output and efficiency
    return {
        'optimal_fuel_composition': optimal_fuel_composition,
        'optimal_temperature': optimal_temperature,
        'optimal_confinement_time': optimal_confinement_time,
        'max_power_output': max_power_output,
        'max_efficiency': max_efficiency
    }
```

This function `optimize_fusion_reactor_parameters` iterates through all possible combinations of fuel composition, temperature, and confinement time to find the parameters that yield the maximum power output and efficiency. It uses the `calculate_power_output` and `calculate_efficiency` functions (not shown) to calculate the power output and efficiency for each combination of parameters.

The function returns a dictionary containing the optimal fuel composition, temperature, and confinement time, as well as the corresponding maximum power output and efficiency.
